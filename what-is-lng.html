								<h3 class="major"> What is LNG? </h3>
                            <p> LNG (Liquified Nature Gas) is natural gas (primarily methane) that has been converted into liquid
                                so thay could transport it easily. It takes up about 1/600th the volume of natural gas in
                                gas state. LNG has less waste, odourless and colourless. The liquifaction process involves
                                removal of certain components, such as dust, acid, gases, helium, water, and heavy carbons.
                                The natural gas is then condensed into a liquid at close to atmospheric pressure by cooling
                                it to approximately -162 Â°C. Maximum transport pressure is set around 25 kPa. </p>

                            <br>
                            <p> LNG achieves a higher reduction in volume than Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) so that the energy
                                density of LNG is 2.4 times greater than that of CNG or 60% that of diesel fuel. This makes
                                LNG cost efficient to transport over long distances where pipelines do not exist. Specially
                                designed cryogenic sea vessels (LNG carriers) or cryogenic road tankers are used for its
                                transport. LNG is principally used for transporting natural gas to markets, where it is regasified
                                and distributed as pipeline natural gas. It can be used in natural gas vehicles, although
                                it is more common to design vehicles to use compressed natural gas. Its relatively high cost
                                of production and the need to store it in expensive cryogenic tanks have hindered widespread
                                commercial use. Despite these drawbacks, on energy basis LNG production is expected to hit
                                10% of the global crude production by 2020

                            <h3> What is it used for? </h3>
                            <p> LNG is used for varieties of purposes such as heat and power generation. Natural gas can be used
                                to turn a turbine. From the turbine, the eneergy got transferred into moving electrons which
                                is electric current. The flows of electrons then moves through the transformer and then flows
                                through high tension power line. Then the flows continues through the power grid before goes
                                to the society and your house. <br>
                                Natural gas are used for our stove and oven as well, they are transferred through pipeline to your house. <br>
                                The natural gas power plants works the same way as other power plants, the only difference is the fuel to turn the generator. Natural gas power plant is more efficient than the other power plants, because the waste heat from the gas-turbine process is directed toward generating steam, whichis then used to generate electricity. This type of power plant can achieve thermal efficiencies up to 50 to 50 percent.
